Question 1: React JS Component Development

Scenario: Create a simple React JS application for a weather dashboard that allows users to search
    for current weather information by city.

1. Requirements:
    1. API Integration:
        - Use a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch current weather data.
        - Implement API calls using async/await.

2. Components:
    - Create a Search component for searching cities.
    - Create a WeatherDisplay component to display current weather information.

3. State Management:
    - Use React hooks for state management.

4. Styling:
    - Use basic CSS or CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components) for styling.
    - Ensure the application is responsive.

5. Additional Features:
    - Implement error handling for API calls.
    - Add a loading spinner while data is being fetched.
