Question 3: HTML and CSS Layout

Scenario: Create a simple, responsive landing page for a tech startup. The page should include a
header, a hero section, and a footer.

1. Requirements:
    - Header:
        - Include a logo and navigation links.

2. Hero Section:
    - Include a headline, a subheadline, and a call-to-action button.

3. Footer:
    - Include links to social media and contact information.

4. Styling:
    - Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout.
    - Ensure the page is fully responsive and accessible (ARIA roles and attributes,
        keyboard navigation).
    - Use modern CSS techniques (e.g., CSS variables, custom properties)
