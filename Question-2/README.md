Question 2: JavaScript Functionality

Scenario: You are given an array of objects representing users and their activities on a website.
Each object contains a userId, activityType, and timestamp. Write a JavaScript function to analyze the
data.

1. Requirements:
    - Data Structure:
        - The input data is an array of objects, e.g., [{ userId: 1, activityType: 'login', timestamp: '2024-
        06-14T10:00:00Z' }, ...].

2. Functionality:
    - Write a function to count the number of unique users.
    - Write a function to find the most common activity type.
    - Write a function to generate a timeline of activities for each user, sorted by
        timestamp.

3. Output:
    - The functions should return their results in an appropriate data structure (e.g.,
        object, array).
